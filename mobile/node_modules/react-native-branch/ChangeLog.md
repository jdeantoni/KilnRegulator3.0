2019-05-22  Version 3.0.1
  * Added Carthage/Build/iOS to Framework Search Paths for Carthage support.
  * Uses native Branch SDKs 3.2.0 (Android), 0.27.0 (iOS).

2019-04-30  Version 3.0.0
  * Changed `implementation` to `api` in build.gradle. This exposes the native
      Branch SDK to native code and avoids the need to import
      `io.branch.sdk.android:library` in the `app/build.gradle`, which
      introduces the potential for conflicts. The `app/build.gradle` import
      via `implementation 'io.branch.sdk.android:library:3.1.2'`
      is no longer necessary and should be removed.
  * Uses native Branch SDKs 3.1.2 (Android), 0.27.0 (iOS).

2019-04-19  Version 3.0.0-rc.1
  * Removed docs folder from distro.
  * Updated to iOS SDK 0.26.0, Android 3.1.1.
  * Removed Branch-SDK & react-native-branch-segment podspecs. Removed Branch
    iOS SDK source code from distribution in favor of using CocoaPods.
  * Renamed cached_initial_event parameter +rn_cached_initial_event.
  * Updated all examples to RN 0.59.6, React 16.8.6.
  * NPM is not currently supported (#433). package-lock.json removed from all
    examples. NPM removed from instructions in docs.

    **Updating to 3.0.0**
      - If using the `cached_initial_event` parameter, change it to
        `+rn_cached_initial_event`.
      - \[Android] Add `implementation 'io.branch.sdk.android:library:3.+'` to `app/build.gradle`.
      - \[Android] Change the call to `Branch.getAutoInstance` in `Application.onCreate` to
        `RNBranchModule.getAutoInstance`.
      - \[iOS] Add version 0.26.0 of the Branch pod to your Podfile:

    **Pure RN app with react-native link**
      - If you already have a Podfile, add `pod 'Branch', '0.26.0'`. Then run
        `pod install`.
      - If you don't have a Podfile, add one to your `ios` subdirectory using
         these contents:

        ```
        platform :ios, "9.0"
        use_frameworks!
        pod "Branch", "0.26.0"
        target "MyApp"
        ```

        Change `MyApp` to the name of your application target. Install CocoaPods
         if necessary: https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation.
         Run `pod install` in the ios subdirectory. Note that this creates a workspace called
        `MyApp.xcworkspace` in the same directory. From now on, open the workspace,
        not the project.
      - Note that if your local podspec repo is quite old, you may need to update
         it to get the current version of the Branch SDK. Do this by running
         `pod install --repo-update` or by running `pod repo update` before
         `pod install`.

    **Native iOS app with the react-native-branch pod**
      - Remove `pod 'Branch-SDK'` from your Podfile. Run `pod install`.

2017-05-19  Version 2.0.0-beta.5

    Now `params` will never be null in the callback. Non-Branch links are
    available using the `+non_branch_link` parameter, like the rest of Branch's SDKs. See in particular the
    webview_example for updated usage. The `uri` parameter still exists, and its behavior is largely unchanged, but
    it should now be considered deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

  * Includes native SDKs 0.14.12 (iOS), 2.6.1 (Android).

2017-04-26  Version 2.0.0-beta.3

  * This release fixes an Android crash introduced in 2.0.0-beta.2. (#187)
  * Includes native SDKs 0.14.12 (iOS), 2.6.1 (Android).

2017-04-24  Version 2.0.0-beta.2

  * Implemented an RCTEventEmitter in iOS.
  * Rebuilt JS link caching to address #79.
  * Corrected link property mappings on Android (thanks to @jchesne for the PR).
  * Includes native SDKs 0.14.12 (iOS), 2.6.1 (Android).
  * Added missing AddToCartEvent, listed in the docs.
  * Export event constants from the native layer for better consistency.
  * Support for routing links in native Android apps that include RN components.
  * Added/improved example applications. The master branch includes five examples for 2.0.0:
    - testbed_simple
    - testbed_native_ios
    - testbed_native_android
    - webview_example
    - webview_native_ios
    As well as the two legacy examples testbed_carthage and testbed_cocoapods for 1.1. The
    webview_example and webview_example_native_ios apps are complete, practical examples of
    content-sharing apps that route links and follow Branch's best practices. All examples
    are fully set up for the bnctestbed.app.link domain.
  * All 2.0 examples now include support for both the test and live Branch keys. All Android
    examples will use the test key in Debug builds and the live key in Release builds. This
    is also true for testbed_simple and webview_example. testbed_native_ios and
    webview_example_native_ios use custom build configurations and schemes to differentiate
    the live and test environments (this approach is only possible when using CocoaPods on iOS;
    it is easily arranged using productFlavors on Android and very similar to the existing
    setup).
  * Added an experimental Fastlane plugin to set up example apps for iOS without using Xcode
    to make it easy to run them on a device and test link routing.
  * Greatly expanded CI and unit testing, including native unit tests, for improved stability.

2017-03-23  Version 2.0.0-beta.1

  * Reduce the number of manual steps required to get started.
  * Remove any need for CocoaPods, Carthage or manual iOS SDK installation in a React Native app.
  * Pin to specific versions of the native SDKs to avoid issues arising from version mismatches.
  * Fully support integration of react-native-branch in a React Native component within a native
    app that also uses the native Branch SDK.
  * Includes native SDKS 0.13.5 (iOS), 2.5.9 (Android)

  See [Release 2.0.0](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/react-native-branch-deep-linking/blob/master/docs/Release-2.0.0.md) for more details.

  immediately, e.g. when componentWillUnmount() is called.

  * The native iOS dependencies for the testbed apps were updated to 0.13.5.
